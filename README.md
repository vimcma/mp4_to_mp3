I've made this project just for fun. To split oudio from the videos I'm making on my phone.

In the code I've used ffmpeg tool and pydub for python.

Starting from the V2 because in first version was no possibility to choose the bitrate.

P.S. I'm not sure that I'll be uprading this project, time will show.
