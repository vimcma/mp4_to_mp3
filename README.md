I've made this project just for fun. To split audio from the videos I'm making on my phone.

In the code I've used ffmpeg tool and pydub for python.

Starting from the V2 because in first version was no possibility to choose the bitrate.

P.S. 1. I'm not sure that I'll be uprading this project, time will show.
     2. Please make sre that you have ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe tools in the same folder with the script.
     3. it will take files from the folder named "mp4" (create it and place the mp4 files there) also in te same directory with the script.
     4. Audio files in mp3 format will be stored to the folder "mp3" (will be created automatically by the script after it will start converting) in the same directory with the script.
